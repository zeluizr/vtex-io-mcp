A release note informs users about updates, enhancements, and bug fixes in a new product version.

## Writing a release note

| **Topic** | **Description** |
| --------- | --------------- |
| **Introduction** | Start the first paragraph with an overview, explaining the change and its impact. Ensure the reader immediately understands how the changes will affect their store operations. |
| **"What has changed?"** | Explain the changes introduced by the release. |
| **"Why did we make this change?"** | Explain what motivated VTEX to create it and the issues that were solved. |
| **"What needs to be done?"** | Guide readers on how to leverage these new capabilities or adapt to changes. Add a call to action to direct the reader to additional information. |

## Release note tags

Release notes must have the following tags at their beginning:

| **Tag name** | **Icon** | **Description** |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------- |
| `added`      | `+`      | New features, functionalities, or components introduced in the release. |
| `deprecated` | `➖` | A feature, function, or component is no longer recommended for use. |
| `info` | `ℹ` | Important information or updates that aren't tied to specific changes but are relevant for users. |
| `fixed` | `✔` | Bugs or issues that have been solved in the release. |
